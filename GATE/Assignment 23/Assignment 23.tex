    \item[4.] In 2022, June Huh was awarded the Fields medal, which is the highest prize in
    Mathematics.\\When he was younger, he was also a poet. He did not win any medals in the
    International Mathematics Olympiads. He dropped out of college.\\ Based only on the above information, which one of the following statements can be
    logically inferred with certainty?
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\Alph*)]
        \item Every Fields medalist has won a medal in an International Mathematics Olympiad.
        \item Everyone who has dropped out of college has won the Fields medal.
        \item All Fields medalists are part-time poets.

    \item[5.]  A line of symmetry is defined as a line that divides a figure into two parts in a way
    such that each part is a mirror image of the other part about that line.\\

    The given figure consists of 16 unit squares arranged as shown. In addition to the
    three black squares, what is the minimum number of squares that must be coloured
    black, such that both PQ and MN form lines of symmetry? (The figure is
    representative)

    \item[6.]  Human beings are one among many creatures that inhabit an imagined world. In
    this imagined world, some creatures are cruel. If in this imagined world, it is given
    that the statement “Some human beings are not cruel creatures” is FALSE, then
    which of the following set of statement(s) can be logically inferred with certainty?\\
    (i) All human beings are cruel creatures.\\
    (ii) Some human beings are cruel creatures.\\
    (iii) Some creatures that are cruel are human beings.\\
    (iv) No human beings are cruel creatures.\\

    \item[7.] To construct a wall, sand and cement are mixed in the ratio of 3:1. The cost of sand
    and that of cement are in the ratio of 1:2. \\
    If the total cost of sand and cement to construct the wall is 1000 rupees, then what
    is the cost (in rupees) of cement used?

    \item[8.] The World Bank has declared that it does not plan to offer new financing to Sri
    Lanka, which is battling its worst economic crisis in decades, until the country has
    an adequate macroeconomic policy framework in place. In a statement, the World
    Bank said Sri Lanka needed to adopt structural reforms that focus on economic
    stabilisation and tackle the root causes of its crisis. The latter has starved it of
    foreign exchange and led to shortages of food, fuel, and medicines. The bank is
    repurposing resources under existing loans to help alleviate shortages of essential
    items such as medicine, cooking gas, fertiliser, meals for children, and cash for
    vulnerable households.\\
    Based only on the above passage, which one of the following statements can be
    inferred with certainty?
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\Alph*)]
        \item According to the World Bank, the root cause of Sri Lanka’s economic crisis is that
        it does not have enough foreign exchange.
        \item The World Bank has stated that it will advise the Sri Lankan government about how
        to tackle the root causes of its economic crisis.
        \item According to the World Bank, Sri Lanka does not yet have an adequate
        macroeconomic policy framework.
        \item The World Bank has stated that it will provide Sri Lanka with additional funds for
        essentials such as food, fuel, and medicines.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item[10.] Which one of the following shapes can be used to tile (completely cover by
    repeating) a flat plane, extending to infinity in all directions, without leaving any
    empty spaces in between them? The copies of the shape used to tile are identical
    and are not allowed to overlap.
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\Alph*)]
        \item circle 
        \item regular octagon
        \item regular pentagon

    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\Alph*)]
        \item $\nabla \phi$
        \item $\nabla\times\brak{\phi\overrightarrow{r}}$
        \item $\phi\overrightarrow{r}$
        \item $\brak{\nabla\phi.d\overrightarrow{r}}\overrightarrow{r}$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[12.] If a monoatonic and continuous function $y = f\brak{x}$ has only one root in the interval $X_1<X<X_2$, then 
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\Alph*)]
        \item $f\brak{X_1}f\brak{X_2}>0$
        \item $f\brak{X_1}f\brak{X_2}=0$

        \item $f\brak{X_1}-f\brak{X_2}>0$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[13.] Consider one-dimensional wave equation $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$ for $-\infty<X<\infty, t\geq 0$. For an initial condition $u\brak{x,0}=e^{-x^2},$ the solution at t = 1 is

        \item $u\brak{x,1}=e^{-\brak{x-1}^2}$
        \item $u\brak{x,1}=e^{-1}$
