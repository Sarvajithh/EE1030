    \item[30.] In a four bar planar mechanism shown in the figure, AB = 5 cm, AD = 4 cm and DC = 2 cm. In the configuration shown, both AB and DC are perpendicular to AD. The bar AB rotates with an angular velocity of 10 $\frac{rad}{s}$. The magnitude of angular velocity (in $\frac{rad}{s}$) of bar DC at this instant is \hfill (2019)

    \item[31.] The rotor of a turbojet engine of an aircraft has a mass 180 kg and polar moment of inertia 10 kgÂ·$m^2$ about the rotor axis. The rotor rotates at a constant speed of $1100 \frac{rad}{s}$ in the clockwise direction when viewed from the front of the aircraft. The aircraft while flying at a speed of 800 km per hour takes a turn with a radius of 1.5 km to the left. The gyroscopic moment exerted by the rotor on the aircraft structure and the direction of motion of the nose when the aircraft turns, are \hfill (2019)

    \item[32.] The wall of a constant diameter pipe of length 1 m is heated uniformly with flux q''by wrapping a heater coil around it. The flow at the inlet to the pipe is hydrodynamically fully developed. The fluid is incompressible and the flow is assumed to be laminar and steady all through the pipe. The bulk temperature of the fluid is equal to  $0^{\circ}C$ at the inlet and $50^{\circ}C$ at the exit. The wall temperatures are measured at three locations, P, Q and R, as shown in the figure. The flow thermally develops  after some distance from the inlet. The following measurements are made:\hfill (2019)

    \item[33.] A gas is heated in a duct as it flows over a resistance heater. Consider a 101 kW electric heating system. The gas enters the heating section of the duct at 100 kPa and $27^{\circ}C$ with a volume flow rate of $15 \frac{m^3}{s}$. If heat is lost from the gas in the duct to the surroundings at a rate of 51 kW, the exit temperature of the gas is \hfill (2019)

The yield strength $(S_y)$ in uniaxial tension/compression of the material of the block is 300 MPa and it follows the Tresca (maximum shear stress) criterion. Assume that the entire block has started yielding. At a point where $\sigma_x =$40 MPa (compressive) and $\tau_{xy = 0}$,  the stress component $\sigma_y$ is\hfill (2019)

    \item[35.] In orthogonal turning of a cylindrical tube of wall thickness 5 mm, the axial and the tangential cutting forces were measured as 1259 N and 1601 N, respectively. The measured chip thickness after machining was found to be 0.3 mm. The rake angle was $10^{\circ}$ and the axial feed was $100 \frac{mm}{min}$. The rotational speed of the spindle was 1000 rpm.
